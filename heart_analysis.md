## Prediction of Heart Attacks Using Machine Learning

Heart attacks continue to be one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making their prevention or at least mitigation an urgent challenge. However, the complexity of the risk factors involved, such as family history, lifestyle, and pre-existing health conditions, makes predicting heart attacks a challenging task. In this context, different machine learning models emerge as effective tools that, using medical datasets, can identify subtle patterns that might be precursors to a heart attack.

With this in mind, this work aims to use different machine learning models, from simpler ones like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and decision trees to more complex ones like neural networks, to predict heart attacks using a dataset containing information on a series of patients, their health-related variables, and whether or not they experienced a heart attack.

The work was implemented in Python and can be analyzed [here](https://github.com/thiagocasag/heart_attack_analysis).
